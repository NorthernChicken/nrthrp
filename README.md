# nrthrp
The completely impractical, greyscale only, dumb image file format I made at 11 PM because I was bored
# Usage
1. Put the (png) image you want to convert into the root folder. Name it ```encode.png```.
2. Install the requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the encode script: ```python png2nrthrp.py```
4. the output file should appear.
5. To decode the image back to png, use ```python nrthrp2png.py```.

Currently you can't actually view the image in its .nrthrp form, so you have to convert it back to a png, making this even more worthless
