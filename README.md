The completely impractical, greyscale only, dumb image file format I made at 11 PM because I was bored
# Usage
1. Put the (png) image you want to convert into the root folder. Name it ```encode.png```.
2. Install the requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the encode script: ```python encode.py```
4. the output file should appear.
5. To decode the image back to png, use ```python decode.py```.
